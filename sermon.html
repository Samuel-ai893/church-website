                    <p> God of the Eleventh Hour

                        Thursday, 19th November 2024<br>
                        
                        In the Book of Matthew 20:1-16 <br/ >
                         
                        [1]  “For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.  
                        [2]  Now when he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard.
                        [3]  And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,
                        [4]  and said to them, ‘You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.’ So they went. 
                        [5]  Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did likewise. 
                        [6]  And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle, and said to them, ‘Why have you been standing here idle all day?’ 
                        [7]  They said to him, ‘Because no one hired us.’ He said to them, ‘You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right you will receive.’ 
                        [8]  “So when evening had come, the owner of the vineyard said to his steward, ‘Call the laborers and give them their wages, beginning with the last to the first.’  
                        [9]  And when those came who were hired about the eleventh hour, they each received a denarius.  
                        [10] But when the first came, they supposed that they would receive more; and they likewise received each a denarius.  
                        [11] And when they had received it, they complained against the landowner,  
                        [12] saying, ‘These last men have worked only one hour, and you made them equal to us who have borne the burden and the heat of the day.’  
                        [13] But he answered one of them and said, ‘Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a denarius?  
                        [14] Take what is yours and go your way. I wish to give to this last man the same as to you. 
                        [15] Is it not lawful for me to do what I wish with my own things? Or is your eye evil because I am good?’  
                        [16] So the last will be first, and the first last. For many are called, but few chosen.” <br><br> 
                        <p>--- Message ---<br>
                            Someone is already thinking “December is here, yet again and my expectation has not been met. 
                            Worry no more because you are dealing with the God of the eleventh hour.
                            God does not respect persons but principles; neither is He partial. 
                            What He says to one, He says to all. 
                            From the scripture, one can observe that God gave all the workers the same reward in spite of the fact that some of them came earlier than others. 
                            What does that tell you?
                            God can still bring about the manifestation of your expectation.
                            Some people’s expectations may have come in the first few months of the year and  yours can come any moment from now. 
                            God is not intimidated or rattled by time or date; He can do what He wants to do in a matter of seconds. 
                            Judging from the  scripture for today, what you shall get at the eleventh hour will not be less than what the other people received.<br><br>
                            <p>Second Coming Testimony <br>
                            At the Eleventh hour of the year, what we have been pursuing for five years was given to us on the platter of gold.
                            Notably, We received our Land Property.
                            Praise God. 
                            You must always bear in mind that God does not think the way we think; His thought process, plan, and will are very different from that of man. What we do is to get closer to Him so that we can get a glimpse of His will, plan, and purpose.
                            Beloved, so many people are busy counting and calculating the blessings of other people, while looking at God from the corner of their eyes and wondering why their own blessing hasn’t come, instead of focusing on building their faith and refreshing their expectation.
                            God is a perfect planner; He is never late. 
                            You must also remember that when it rains, it pours. Fan the flame of your expectation; the year is not over. 
                            Remain expectant. <br><br></p>
