                <h2>Lenten Testimony Retreat</h2>
                    <p> What I want to share from January of this year is that God really came and said it's okay; the anointing He gave the church is being used. This means there is no longer any anointing to be received as of now other than the one He has given us. All those anointings He has given us before have been working in our ministry. I told you when I traveled last year, one of our family member's daughters was crying all the time whenever she saw strangers. 
                        Then, when the mother brought her to Pastor James Akindele's house in London, the only thing I remember is that the wrath of God just went out because she became a nuisance. Nobody was able to carry her to soothe her and stop her from crying. Then, the power of God came forth and rebuked Satan. He said that the spirit of fear was cast away from her and everybody there saw her, though she didn't stop crying for about an hour. 
                        But when I went to England this year, we visited the family of that young girl, and to our surprise, she has stopped crying permanently. Praise God! I want to thank God for healing my left ear. A few weeks ago, my left ear became blocked, and it was very uncomfortable. I thought it would open on its own, but there was no change. I decided to call my pastor.James Akindele, and he prayed for me. By the grace of God, after three more days, my ear completely opened 
                        and I was healed! I give all the glory to God for His healing power. Praise God! Sister Nike. That's two testimonies of the many things that the Lord is doing. Anywhere I go, God always releases anointing when it is necessary. I have more confidence and trust in Him. That's why you see all those testimonies; nearly every week, something new surely happens. For example, it is where money treasures are; that is where thieves go. The devil doesn't attack empty lives. 
                        If your life is empty, just design your life; nothing is going to happen in your life. You will have a free life. Nothing good is in the devil and he is bad. But when he sees you, he knows that one day this girl is going to marry a billionaire. Oh my God, he can deny you a good husband. So you will have to wait a little bit in the Lord for God to confirm you; that's called the days of visitation or trial. 
                        Time will not permit me to speak about someone who got pregnant at the age of 45, so that the God we are serving can do all things. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah! There is no comparison in the realm of the spirit; it is only what God asks you to do and if you are able to do it, it's okay with God. God is happy with you. All you need in this world is the guidance of the Holy Spirit for God to be happy with you, whether you have little or much, whether you have a house or not 
                        and whether you have a car or not. What matters is your relationship with God Almighty. That's what truly matters. When He called me, I didn't speak for nine months and even when He called me in the third month, I still didn't speak. He came personally, took my two hands from my sides and placed them on my chest. Then He laid His hand of resurrection on me, which means He knows me. He came from billions of miles away, out of the galaxies, 
                        to a very humble person like me and touched me physically. Do you believe that Jesus Christ touched me physically? I'm not talking about a dream or revelation; I'm referring to the physical manifestation of His presence. I am really happy that each step I take is accompanied by financial steps and steps in the gospel. Every step that I take, He is the One who is guiding me because He is here with us physically; He is here with me. " Son, I'm going to be with you until the end.
                        " Not only that, however, I will remain with you till the end. Amen
