                <h2>Believe and change your life's direction today</h2>
                    <p> "It is written in the Bible that Jesus Christ said, "Carry your cross and follow me," because He Himself carried His cross and followed God. 
                        The things of the Spirit are like this: they will take you down, it will bring you to the mountain, and it will take you to the depths of the river, but it will bring you out again. 
                        All those things He is doing for you are to wash you clean for the work He is going to give you. Our church is very young, 
                        considering that it started in January of this year, 2024, where we began to see all that God has promised us over the years.
                        Revelation 22:12 (KJV) And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.
