                <h2>About us </h2>
                    <p> God always speaks to me in January and I am full of expectation for what He is going to say again but I didn't see anything.
                        Then the Holy Spirit convinced me that if He didn't do anything, it was okay to go ahead and use the anionting ministry He asked for. Since January, things have changed. 
                        First, I have more confidence because I'm not asking for any anointing. That's why you see all those testimonies; nearly every week, good news always happens. 
                        Time will not permit me to speak about someone who got pregnant at the age of 45, so the God we are serving can do all things for me; just have faith and trust more.
                        Praise the Lord. Hallelujah! This trip I took was just to refresh myself and to rethink my calling. 
                        If I were in Nigeria, I would be doing the same thing all the time, but there I was not doing the same thing. 
                        I was able to wait on the Lord. Bro Shina in the UK gave me his room privately; he offered it to me. During that session, I was praying and asking God. 
                        I would talk to God, and God would talk back to me, like when Moses went to the mountains. 
                        I did not go there this time around for much pleasure; I went to the mountains in London to rethink my ministry and the Lord has answered me. 
                        Let's start from the inception of the ministry in 1990; that was 34 years ago. I thought the ministry He gave me was going to be like other people's ministries. 
                        I don't know what it has in store for me. I went to Bible college and studied diplomatiology just to gain knowledge but at the same time, 
                        I believe in the leading of the Spirit and I want the Holy Spirit to guide me because that is where we are rewarded. Great reward, great reward comes when the Spirit of the Lord is leading. 
                        For example, Moses in the Bible had three million followers; the Lord was leading him. Elijah had one disciple guided by the Holy Spirit and Jesus Christ was able to save only one hundred and twenty. 
                        This means that what was unique in their lives is not how many people followed them, whether they had a big church or a small church. What matters most is the leading of the Holy Spirit. 
                        The person who had three million followers was justified on the Mount of Transfiguration and the person who had only one apostle or one disciple was Elijah. 
                        He was not left behind at the Mount of Transfiguration; both of them are equal, whether you have three million followers or a single follower. 
                        Elijah, as far as the Holy Spirit is guiding you or leading you, you are justified before God. There is no comparison in the realm of the spirit; it is only what God asks you to do and if you are able to do it, it's okay with God.
                        God is happy with you. All you need in this world is the guidance of the Holy Spirit for God to be happy with you, whether you have little or much, whether you have a house or not, whether you have a car or not. 
                        What matters is your relationship with God Almighty. That's what matters. When I visited England, I went to refresh my relationship with my Maker. 
                        When He called me, I didn't speak for nine months and when He called me in the third month, I still didn't speak. He came personally, took my two hands from my sides and placed them on my chest. 
                        Then He laid His hands on me, His hand of resurrection, which means He knows me. He came from billions of miles away, out of the galaxies, to a very humble person like me and touched me physically. 
                        Do you believe that Jesus touched me physically? I'm not talking about a dream or revelation; I'm referring to the physical manifestation of His presence. 
                        This means the work He is going to give me must be very important to Him to convince me that, "Son, I'm going to be with you till the end." Not only that, but I am with you till the end. 
                        I am really convinced that each step I take is with Him-financial steps, steps in the gospel. Every step that I take has the One guiding me because He is here with us physically; He is here with me. 
                        Though my ministry may be very, very slow, He told me, "Where He put His leg, put your leg there;  say the Lord, thank God I never miss it," and I will never miss it. In Jesus Name. Hallelujah! So, I went back again for two months and was in the presence of the Lord. 
                        Can you believe it? 
                        Everybody wanted to come and see us, but I said no this time around. I didn't come to England for that; I came to reassess the possessions He has given me and to understand what it is that God wants from my life. 
                        I know that He will never miss me. Hallelujah! From inception, I love you all because God loves me. It is a love He has given me that I express to you. I express it to you; you lost me in the time when I did not have anything. 
                        At that time, I was borrowing from everyone in the church to meet my expenses. This means there are sections in people's lives: there is a time to sow and a time to reap, a time to suffer and a time to have pleasure, times of trials, and times of victory. 
                        Those are the times that God has already ordained. To the extent that I told you one day, God took me to heaven. And when I got there, He said, "I raise my hand." I showed Him my hand, and I showed Him my left hand. 
                        He said, "Everything I have written about you, you are trying to fulfill, is perfectly well for your life." He didn't add anything, nor did He remove anything from it. That means your right and left hands are the handwriting of God if you are following Him, and you will fulfill them in your life. 
                        In Jesus' Name. Amen. Iâ€™m thanking the choir, I thank the ministers, and I thank everybody in the church. What is next? That's it. Every time, every founder, we begin to ask God, "What next?" I am a servant of this ministry to the Holy Spirit, but to me, the Holy Spirit has slowed us down to His way. 
                        To me, this is not how I thought it was going to be. Let me tell you, for any church to grow, you have to do evangelism, which we have been denied. The first thing we are taught in Bible college is that immediately we plant a church. I work at Eji-Gbo Church, and we must reach out for souls twice a week. 
                        That is where our reward is, as stated in book of Daniel 12:3, it says: "And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever." There, we are like diamonds added to their crowns. 
                        I read it, and I know that. Jesus said, "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. Anyone that believes shall be saved; anyone that rejects shall be condemned, and I am with you to the end of the world." He gave us assurance that all the power in heaven and earth has been given unto Him. 
                        So now, what do we need? We are supposed to launch out into the deep and bring out dead souls unto salvation. However, when I entered the ministry, everything changed, especially since the ministry doesn't belong to me; it belongs to the Holy Spirit. 
                        Let me tell you, we are taught in Bible college that you can use faith to do anything. You can use faith to get married; you don't need to ask God immediately. If you see somebody who loves you and you love that person, go ahead and marry by faith. 
                        You can use faith to take major steps: you want to study abroad, you want to leave this job, you want to apply for another job, you want to stop your wife from having children; you can use faith for anything.
                        Now, I'm coming to the gospel area: you can use faith to establish a church for God. You base your faith on going into the world and preaching the gospel to every nation. You don't hear another one more than that. 
                        Could you believe that 99% of it works by faith? Everything you use your faith for will work. But when God visits you and tells you, "I'm going to give you a job in my vineyard," the work I am going to give you is not the work I give to others. 
                        It's not like that; that's where we pastors come in. It is not the work that I give to others. I allow them to establish the word by faith, but I pulled you out of billions of people. I want to show my power through you in reality, whatever that means; 
                        God knows in His mind. All I need is for you to surrender, and anyone who follows me must also surrender. If you cannot surrender to the will of the Spirit, you cannot follow me. It is written in the Bible that Jesus Christ said, "Carry your cross and follow me," because He Himself carried His cross and followed God. 
                        Know today that you cannot be my disciple if you do not have enough patience to discern what is of the Spirit. The things of the Spirit are like this: they will take you down, it will bring you to the mountain, and it will take you to the depths of the river, but it will bring you out again. 
                        All those things He is doing for you are to wash you clean for the work He is going to give you. For example, it may make you poor, it may make you rich; you might think that you are sovereign. But if you follow Him, that sovereign will result in something. 
                        Praise the Lord! I pray this morning that the Lord will interpret Himself to you in Jesus name.
